# video to frames extractor

Just put the main.py file in any folder you want and run it with "python main.py" or "python3 main.py".

You must have the numpy and opencv-python libraries installed if you run the .py file.

## The arguments:

video path -> absolute path of the video file or just the name if the video is in the same folder as the extractor.py.

dir name to extract the frames -> absolute path of the folder to extract the frames to.

the other ones are very auto explicative.


## The executable:

you can alternatively download the exe file and follow the instructions there if you don't have or don't want to have
python / the libraries installed.

# For reference

a 5 minute video at 720p with ~7500 frames took around 8 minutes to add noise to all of them.
